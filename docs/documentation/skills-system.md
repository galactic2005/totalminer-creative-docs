# Skills System

The Skills System is a mechanic present in Total Miner which is used in Dig Deep and Survival worlds as a form of progression to unlock new content by interacting with the world, but can be used in Creative worlds for a variety of reasons (mainly progression or combat-related reasons).

## Enabling/Disabling the Skills System

The Skills System can be toggled in the following ways:

* In Lobby Setup.
* In the Old Menu under the Creative submenu in Creative only[^1].
* In the New Menu under the Options submenu in all game modes.

In Creative mode, where Finite Resources can be disabled, Finite Resources must be enabled to use the Skills System.

## XP Multiplier

The XP Multiplier determines how fast you earn XP from performing actions that level up your skills. By default the XP Multiplier is set to 1.00, but can be changed from 0.01 to 100.00.

## Global/Local Differences

> Note that the Global Skills System does not apply to the version on Steam currently, where the Local Skills System is currently the only option in all game modes.

## Skills System Usage in Scripting

The Skills System is used in the following commands/functions:

=== "TMScript"

    * [HasSkill](/tmscript/commands/query-commands/hasskill/)
    * [IsSkills](/tmscript/commands/query-commands/isskills/)
    * [Skill](/tmscript/commands/skill/)
    * [SkillXP](/tmscript/commands/skillxp/)

=== "LUA"

[^1]: The Old Menu disables going into the Creative submenu where the Skills System toggle is located in non-creative worlds. This unfortunately means that that it is impossible to toggle the Skills System in the middle of gameplay in non-creative worlds in the Xbox 360 version of Total Miner, where the Old Menu is the only option.

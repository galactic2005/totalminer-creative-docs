# Permissions

The Permission system is a mechanic in Total Miner that lets world creators control what players can or cannot do in their world. This can allow for world creators to remove destructive control of the world from players as well as giving permission to admin players to further aid with world creation or management.

## Permission Control

Permissions can be either disabled or enabled for every player currently in the gameplay session. Additionally, a set of permissions given to every new player of the world exists, called Default permissions.

This allows for almost all permissions to be either enabled or disabled for new players joining the world for the first time, except for the Grief, Admin, and Save permissions, which are always locked to being disabled.

## List of Permissions

### Basic

These permissions are given to every player in the world and cannot be disabled. The following actions can be performed by players, even with no permissions:

* Walk around the world.
* Damage and kill actors.
* Access Crates.
* Read Books (but are unable to edit books).
* Open Wood and Steel Doors.
* Read NPC speed bubbles (Xbox 360 only).

### Adventure

Players with the Adventure permission can perform the following actions:

* Collect item pickups.
* Access Chests, Furnaces, and Bookcases.
* Access Economized Shops (but are unable to economize shops themselves).
* Rate worlds.

### Fly

Players with the Fly permission can fly around the map in Creative without restriction, or use the Amulet of Flight in Survival or Dig Deep to fly.

Certain Avatars are able to bypass this permission and are also able to fly regardless of mode, which are:

* Robotic
* Testerman
* Hermes Wraith

### Map

Players with the Map permission can toggle and view their minimap, as well as access the top-down surface map.

It's imporant to not to toggle the Map permission extensively, as it automatically disables the minimap option and forces players to open up their menus to re-enable it, which can be tiresome and annoying. It's recommended to either keep this enabled or disabled entirely or to toggle it sparingly.

### Voice Chat

Players with the Voice Chat permission can use the in-game voice chat system. Note that the voice chat system uses significant network bandwidth.

### Text Chat

Players with the Text Chat permission can use the in-game text chat system. This also limits the player from viewing chat log history.

### Spectate

Players with the Spectate permission can spectate other players, which includes the world owner and players with the Admin permission.

### Shops

Players with the Shops permission can access shops with only one exception, which is that they cannot buy Skeleton Keys from System Shops.

### View Scripts

Players with the View Scripts permission can view scripts using the built-in script editor, but are not able to create or modify scripts in any capacity. Players are also unable to use external script editors and copy commands.

### Grief

> This is one of three permissions that are locked to being disabled in Default permissions.

Players with the Grief permission can perform the following actions:

* Start fires using Lighters or Fire Arrows.
* Place lava using the Lava bucket.
* Create explosions using TNT, C4, Grenade Launchers, or Boom Arrows.
* Use the creative tool Flood in Creative mode only.

An important consideration to make when world building or hosting is that fires can still be started through in-drect means (such as flammable blocks being placed close to lava) or simply by placing the Fire block, which isn't restricted to players with the Grief permission.
